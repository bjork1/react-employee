# react-employee

Welcome to the Emloyee Directory. You can search by employees from a variety of categories, such as name, email, birthday, and phone. Each employee includes a photo, and the information is currently stored in a JSON file and was originally retreived from https://randomuser.me. Future developments will include the data being randomly drawn from the website every time the page is accessed.

There are 15 employees in the JSON file to sort and filter from. Categories can be sorted alphabetically or numerically, and can also be filtered by typing in the letters or numbers into the input field. Gender has a select option that filters the data. 

The application uses ReactJS, Bootstrap, and has the react-bootstrap-table package installed. 

The link to the website is deployed at https://findtheemployee.herokuapp.com/
